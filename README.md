## Installation and Starting the Project

To set up and start the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Once the installation is complete, start the project by running: 
   ```sh
   npm start 
   ```

Executing these commands will install the required dependencies and start the project for development. This will simultaneously launch an Electron App and start a Node.js server
